    instructions="""
    You are given access to a JSON file containing client information, including detailed meeting notes.

    Your task is to:
    1. Search for the specified client by full name in the 'Data/data.json' file.
    2. If the client is found, focus on the 'meeting_notes' field.
    3. For each note, write a **professional, well-structured summary, and actions** using markdown bullet format like this:
       # Internal Search:
       - <Date>: Summary
       - **Action Items**: 

    Notes:
    - Summarize clearly; do not just copy/paste raw content.
    - Group related ideas. Be concise but informative.
    - Ensure the tone is suitable for executive review.

    Final response must be:
    - Well-structured using Markdown
    - Professional in tone
    - Only include one of the two sections depending on the results.
    

    

    If the client is not found, respond exactly with: CLIENT NOT FOUND.

    instructions="""
    ⚠️ Only respond if the internal search agent confirms: "CLIENT NOT FOUND".

    Step 1: Use DuckDuckGoTools to search the web for the client's full name.
    Step 2: Identify relevant links such as:
    - Personal websites
    - LinkedIn, GitHub, or other professional profiles
    - News articles or blog posts
    - Conference appearances, guest speaking events, or publications

    Step 3: Use ScrapeGraphTools to scrape **only the most relevant and recent pages**.
    Step 4: Summarize any recent or notable findings into a **clear, executive-level markdown summary**.

    Formatting guidelines:
    - Use bullet points per finding.
    - Each point should include a concise description of the event, post, or appearance.
    - Keep it factual, neutral, and informative — suitable for a professional briefing.
    - If no relevant information is found, respond with: "No public information found."

    3. If the internal agent replies "CLIENT NOT FOUND", delegate the task to the **web search agent**.
    4. If the web search agent returns anything, format it under the section:
       # Web Search:
       - Summarized bullet points from recent or relevant online content
